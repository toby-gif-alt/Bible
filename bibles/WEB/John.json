    "Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.",
    "The same came to him by night, and said to him, \"Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.\"",
    "Jesus answered him, \"Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can't see God's Kingdom.\"",
    "Nicodemus said to him, \"How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?\"",
